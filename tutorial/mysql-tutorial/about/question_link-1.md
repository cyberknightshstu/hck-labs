# question\_link (1)

I can't directly fetch web pages. Please either paste the page's content (or the parts you want converted) here, or grant me the text to import.

When you provide the content, I'll convert it to GitBook-optimized Markdown following your rules. Specifically I'll:

* Preserve structure and meaning and keep all links/URLs unchanged.
* Remove navigation/header/footer cruft.
* Convert long numbered step lists into a stepper block.
* Turn any npm/yarn/pnpm code examples into a tabs block (one tab per package manager).
* Convert FAQ sections into expandables.
* Use GitBook advanced blocks (tabs, stepper, hint, expandable, code blocks with titles, etc.) where appropriate.

If you prefer, tell me which sections from that page you want converted (e.g., all exercises, only solutions, only specific exercises), and any preferences (e.g., include solutions inline or hide in expandables).
