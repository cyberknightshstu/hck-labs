### Design Phases

* Initial phase -- characterize fully the data needs of the prospective database users.
* Second phase -- choosing a data model
  * Applying the concepts of the chosen data model
  * Translating these requirements into a conceptual schema of the database.
  * A fully developed conceptual schema indicates the functional requirements of the enterprise.
    * Describe the kinds of operations (or transactions) that will be performed on the data.
